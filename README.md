This article explains how to choose the right chart for data visualization between a bar chart and a pie chart using [Syncfusion .NET MAUI charts](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/getting-started).

Choosing the right chart type is crucial for effective data visualization. [Bar charts](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/barchart) and [pie charts](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/circular-charts/piechart) are two of the most commonly used visual representations, each serving distinct purposes. A bar chart is ideal for comparing multiple categories and analyzing trends over time, while a pie chart is best suited for showcasing proportional distributions. In this blog, we will explore their differences, benefits, and drawbacks, and guide you in selecting the right chart for your data visualization needs. Weâ€™ll also provide practical examples with .NET MAUI charts, demonstrating how to implement these visualizations in real-world applications.
